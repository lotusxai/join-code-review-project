# Code-Review/Regression
## Introduction
The notes and listed scripts summarizes updating guidelines for the regression analysis performed.
At LotusX while performing a regression analysis, sample data is used to investigate relationships, with an ultimate goal of creating a model to predict a future value for some dependent variable.The process of finding this mathematical model that best fits the data involves regression analysis and its documentation. The following topics are addressed here: simple and multiple linear regression, inference, diagnostics, building a regression model and correlation.
