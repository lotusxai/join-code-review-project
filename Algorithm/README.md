The Computing challenges and problems often can be solved but not always. The best way to get good at optimization and machine learning is to solve as many problems as often as possible. Here, a list of commonly known problems in these fields are grouped for practice:

### Heuristic I: The Invariant Principle
### Heuristic II:The Extremal Principle
### Enumerative and Combinatorics
### Number Theory
### Inequalities
### Induction Principle
### Sequences
### Functional Equation
### Geometry
### Games
